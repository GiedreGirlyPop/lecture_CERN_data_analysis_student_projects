Here are the full zip files to be downloaded at once, the individual files and running details are presented in the other folders: scenes, scripts and game assets. The zip project file should be extracted and loaded into godot as is from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QqSR8aFQZQXTZZYGWSL1u6eZq8i6BtQs/view?usp=sharing. The game can be played by downloading "finalproject_game_giedrekuktaite" from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hu-YsvC1Tc1wnOiBpfQCh9DE6l2jcT1B/view?usp=sharing (the file is too big and i couldn;t upload directly)
