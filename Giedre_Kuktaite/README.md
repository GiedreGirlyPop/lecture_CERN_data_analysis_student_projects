Here are all the files and code needed for performing the data analysis and running the game. The game files via zip and the game itslef can be found in game->fullzip folder. The zip should be downloaded, extracted and uploaded to godot, all scripts and scenes should be then properly loaded allowing for editing and such. Game can be played upon downloading the exe and pck files from that same folder, godot engine is not needed to run. All files are also uploaded in individual folders in the case of looking for just a specific file or group of files.
The data analysis files are in the dataanalysis folder. They should be downloaded and loaded into Visual Studio Code (personal preference). Running it will provide the output used for this game, a different dataset can be uploaded to get different results.
